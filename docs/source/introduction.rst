Introduction
============

Our `editor <https://discountingcashflows-beta.com/valuation/>`_ runs on **Python 3.10** and uses a custom financial modeling framework documented here.

This framework helps you analyze the true value of a stock by projecting future cash flows and calculating key financial metrics. You can work with historical data, set your own assumptions, and visualize results using intuitive charts and tablesâ€”all designed to make financial analysis easier and more insightful.

.. note::

Good to know
------------

The model processes only annualized and LTM (Last Twelve Months) data for now. This means requesting EPS for last year, such as:

.. code-block:: python

   data.get("income:eps:-1")

returns the **annual**, not quarterly, EPS.
